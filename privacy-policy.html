            <h3>Information Collection and Use:</h3>
            <p>
                The "PDF to Image" app is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. We do not collect, store, or transmit any 
                personal information or data from our users. All PDF to image conversions are performed locally on the user's device and 
                do not require an internet connection. The app does not send any data or information to any external servers or third parties.
            </p>    
            <p>
                We understand the importance of protecting your personal information and data. We have designed the "PDF to Image" app to 
                function without collecting or transmitting any user data, so you can use the app with confidence knowing that your privacy is 
                protected.

            <h3>Permissions:</h3>
            <p>The "PDF to Image" app requires access to the user's device storage in order to read and write PDF and image files.
                This permission is necessary for the app to function properly and perform PDF to image conversions. The app does not require 
                any other permissions.
            </p>
            <p>We only request the minimum permissions necessary for the app to function properly. We do not request or require any 
                unnecessary permissions that could compromise your privacy or security.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Security:</h3>
            <p>Since all PDF to image conversions are performed locally on your device, your data is never transmitted or stored outside of your device.
                This means that your data is always under your control. Remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While 
                we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
